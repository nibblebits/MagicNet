1. DATAHASHES DO NOT match 
THEY ARE CHANGED BEFORE ITS Send
TO THE CLIENT
2. EXPECTED SIZES DIFFER MISCALCULATED
3. TOTAL READ BYTES IS 0 ON THE CLIENT
YET SERVER DIFFERS, THIS MIGHT NOT BE BUG
IF the size differs it makes sense why a sha256 caclulation would differ.


CODE SUGGESTS REHASHING AT SOME POINT BEFORE SEND.

WE NOW KNOW THE ENTIRE BUG IS CAUSED ON THE SERVER SIDE WHERE THERES A PROBLEM
WITH VERIFYING THE SIGNATURE AFTER SIGNING, SUGGESTS MEMORY CORRUPTION.
